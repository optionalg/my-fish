# oh-my-fish custom stuff
Plugins and themes for oh-my-fish that I've decided I like enough to move into my own 
private repo so they'll always be available to a new fish shell install.

I have full instructions on installing Fish, which includes grabbing this repo, in 
Nixnote.


config.fish
    This is the config file that actually needs to live in ../  I'm keeping it in here so 
    it gets synced to git.

    At work, ../config.fish is symlinked to ./config.fish, which saves me from having to 
    remember to copy the thing in here whenever I make a change.
